            <p>I honestly believe that my superpower is my ability to take something ordinary and make it extraordinary. Being that I am a creative, well rounded individual, there are numourous things that I'd like to believe I master in. I usually can do anything I set my mind to but it's not about the task I'm completing, it's the way I put my own twist to it. So with that being said, I've always been into web programming; it was my focus study in high school. However, I haven't recieved the chance to perfect my craft. So hopefully, this course will help me do just that.</p>
